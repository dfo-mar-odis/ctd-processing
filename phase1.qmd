Figures ? and ? below display images generated during the CTD oxygen data correction process for mission HUD2021185. The missionâ€™s data set was broken up into two groups because the oxygen sensors were changed part way through the mission.

The first image displays the linear correction computed for group A's primary oxygen sensor.

::: callout-note
If a secondary dissolved oxygen was used on the CTD then there would be a similar process for the secondary sensor; as was for this data set.
