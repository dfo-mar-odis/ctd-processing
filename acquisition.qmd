------------------------------------------------------------------------

At BIO, we use instruments and various other methods to collect data. These sources of data are used in aiding the [Department of Fisheries and Oceans](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/) with its mandate of managing Canadian waters and their resources.

One of the ways data is collected is via electronic instruments. These instruments generally have sensors that are used to measure parameters like dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature, pressure, and fluorescence.

A key oceanographic instrument is called a CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth instrument; see figure 1). A CTD is used to measure oceanographic parameters vertically through the water column, when it is lowered and raised on a cable; or as a time-series at a fixed depth, when the instrument is moored.

![Figure 1. A CTD package housed within a metal frame used to acquire vertical profiles in the water column.](images/ctd.jpg){fig-alt="An image of A CTD package housed within a metal frame used to acquire vertical profiles in the water column." fig-align="center"}

The main sensors are conductivity, temperature, and depth (where depth is computed from the data obtained by a pressure sensor).

There are many other sensors available to measure parameters in marine environments; with more being manufactured every year.

The two main companies that design and sell CTD instruments are [Sea-Bird Scientific](https://www.seabird.com/) and [RBR](https://rbr-global.com/).

Although the vast majority of the CTD data we have collected has been done with instruments from Sea-Bird Scientific; more and more profiles are being collected using instruments from RBR.

So you have successfully collected data - now it's time to clean it!
